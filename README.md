# heroesoflegend.py

The end goal is to convert Task Force Games' old Heroes of Legend book ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2q3SyLsdffGV2NWSERMcTJtdlk/view?usp=sharing ) into a program.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO ANYONE ADDING TO THIS: The rolltables need to be cascading if statements if the roll variable is modified in any way (such as using cuMod). Meanwhile, the other tables that just need to return a string can be set as dicts using the random_choice function. I probably should've planned this out better before I got started.
